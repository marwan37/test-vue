# test-vue

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

> Volar extension is deprecated in favor of Vue 3's built-in language server. You can uninstall the Volar extension and use the built-in language server by setting "vetur.experimental.templateInterpolationService": true in your VS Code settings.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
